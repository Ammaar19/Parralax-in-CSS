# Parralax-in-CSS

A parallax practice website using CSS is a website design that uses the parallax effect to create an illusion of depth and perspective. The parallax effect is achieved by layering different elements of the webpage, which move at different speeds as the user scrolls down the page. This creates a 3D effect that can add visual interest and interactivity to a website.

To create a parallax practice website using CSS, you would typically start by creating an HTML file with the basic structure of the website, including a header, main section, and footer. Inside the main section, you would create two or more div elements with different background images that will be used as the layers of the parallax effect. You would then add content to the page inside the main section, such as headings, paragraphs, and images.

Next, you would use CSS to style the different elements on the page, including setting the background images for the parallax layers and adjusting their heights to fill the screen. You would also use CSS positioning to adjust the position of the parallax layers and set their background-attachment property to fixed to create the parallax effect.

Finally, you would add finishing touches to the design, such as adjusting the font styles and colors, and adding hover effects to links and buttons.

Overall, a parallax practice website using CSS is a creative and visually appealing way to showcase content and engage users with interactive design elements. With some basic HTML and CSS skills, anyone can create a parallax website that looks and feels professional.
